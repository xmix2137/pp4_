## Project Overview
In this workshop, we are building an E-Commerce application from scratch. The project will cover a range of functionalities typical of an E-Commerce platform, product browsing, cart management, order processing, and more.

## Objectives
- Learn Test-Driven Development (TDD) by writing tests before implementing features.
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to design and develop robust, maintainable code.
- Implement best practices and design patterns
- Solve real-world problems encountered in E-Commerce application.

## Technologies Used
- Java: A widely used programming language for building robust and scalable applications.
- Spring Boot: A powerful framework for building Java-based applications, providing dependency injection, MVC architecture, and more.
- JUnit: A popular unit testing framework for Java, essential for practicing Test-Driven Development.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, refer to the [documentation](docs/) and guides provided within the repository for detailed instructions on setting up the project and running tests.
